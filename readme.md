Staged local changes, then pulled the latest changes and then pushed the final code to the repo successfully.

<br>The mock functions are very difficult to understand.
I could understand the basics od mock and its functionality but the advanced type of mock is difficult.  
The things I learned are: 
  ```python
    1. .mock property
    2. mock return values
    3. mocking modules 
  ```
  
<br>Trying to understand the mock implementation now:
=> Could not understand mock implementation, so moving towards snapshot testing.
  
**Snapshot Testing**
<br>Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.

<br>A typical snapshot test case renders a UI component, takes a snapshot, then compares it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.
