The mock functions are very difficult to understand.
I could understand the basics od mock and its functionality but the advanced type of mock is difficult.
The things I learned are: 
  ```python
    1. .mock property of
    2. mock return values
    3. mocking modules 
  ```

Trying to understand the mock implementation now:
=> Could not understand mock implementation, so moving towards snapshot testing.

**Snapshot Testing**
